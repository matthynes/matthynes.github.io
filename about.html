title: About Me
---
<p style="font-size: 15px;">I am a Computer Science undergrad living on a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)">rock</a> in the Atlantic Ocean. I like cats and coffee, and I have a cat named Coffee.</p>
<p>I am a freelance web developer who is passionate about what I do and the myriad of technologies I get to interact with and
  learn about everyday. Also, Python is my jam.</p>
<p>You can see some of the work I've done on my GitHub page. If you'd like to commission some work (or send me a cute picture of your own cat), just send me an email. I'd love to hear
  from you!</p>
