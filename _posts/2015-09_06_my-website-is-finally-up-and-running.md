##Introduction##

Hello, everybody! I'm very excited to finally have my own website. I had a lot of fun building it and learning a new technology, Jekyll, along the way.
I'll continue to improve it and hopefully learn even more new things as time goes on.

This will serve as both my personal and professional website. Eventually I'll add a portfolio of work that I've done. I'll also blog about things that interest me; it will probably be mainly technology-related posts but there could be a discussion about world events or personal stuff from time to time.
